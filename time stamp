\title{Beyond the Cogito: A Structural Resistance Criterion for Essence}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This article argues that the Cartesian cogito collapses as an ontological foundation once its material fallibility is accepted. We propose a new criterion for essence: the Structural Resistance Criterion for Essence (SRCE). We argue that thought, lacking a persistent and verifiable structure, cannot ``be'' but only ``function.'' An operational ontological taxonomy is presented (Being vs. Functioning vs. Sublimated Functioning) to reclassify entities. We demonstrate that, under this criterion, most entities (including thought, AI, and institutions) merely ``function,'' while Truth emerges as the only candidate for pure ``Being.'' Finally, we analyse the ontological status of God, concluding that it can only ``function in a sublimated mode,'' subordinated to Truth. Methodologically, SRCE reframes essence as structural resistance rather than modal profile or cognitive transparency.

\section{Introduction: The Limits of Certainty}

\subsection{The Cartesian Foundation: The Cogito as Refuge of Modern Certainty}

The Cartesian \textit{cogito ergo sum} has served as the bedrock of modern philosophy since Descartes formulated it in his \textit{Meditations on First Philosophy} \citep{descartes1996}. Faced with radical doubt---the possibility that an evil demon might deceive him about all external reality---Descartes retreated to what he considered an impregnable fortress: the thinking self. Even if he were deceived about everything else, the very act of being deceived would require a thinking subject. Therefore, ``I think, therefore I am'' became the Archimedean point upon which the edifice of modern epistemology and ontology could be erected.

The appeal of the cogito lies in its apparent self-evidence. It seems to require no external verification, no material substrate, no reference beyond itself. The act of thinking appears to guarantee its own existence in a way that no other phenomenon does. This supposed independence from materiality has made the cogito attractive not only as an epistemological starting point but as an ontological claim about the fundamental nature of the self.

However, this very independence---this supposed freedom from material contingency---is what we shall interrogate. For if thought requires a material substrate that is itself vulnerable to malfunction, then the cogito cannot serve as the ultimate guarantor of Being. The foundation crumbles not because thinking cannot occur, but because thinking itself might be structurally flawed---a broken lamp that nevertheless produces the illusion of illumination.

\subsection{Material Dependence: Thought Requires a Vulnerable Substrate}

Contemporary neuroscience and philosophy of mind have made increasingly clear what was perhaps less obvious in Descartes' time: thought is not an immaterial substance but an emergent phenomenon dependent upon a highly complex material substrate---the brain. This dependency is not merely instrumental, as if the brain were a tool that the mind employs; rather, thought appears to be constitutively dependent upon neural processes. Damage to specific brain regions eliminates specific cognitive capacities; neurochemical imbalances produce predictable alterations in thought patterns; the developmental trajectory of the brain determines the emergence and character of conscious experience.

This material dependence introduces a fundamental vulnerability into the Cartesian edifice. If thought requires a brain, and if brains can malfunction---through disease, injury, chemical imbalance, or developmental anomaly---then thought itself can malfunction. The thinking that guarantees ``I am'' might itself be defective. But if the instrument of verification is potentially flawed, how can it verify anything, including its own existence?

The problem is not simply that we can be wrong about the content of our thoughts---Descartes anticipated this with his demon hypothesis. The problem is that the very process of thinking might be fundamentally compromised, such that even the meta-cognitive act of recognising oneself as thinking could be an artefact of malfunction.

\subsection{Central Thesis: The Oxymoronic Being Paradox}

This recognition leads us to what we shall call the \textit{Oxymoronic Being Paradox}: a malfunction that thinks of itself as light. The paradox can be formulated thus: if thought can be structurally flawed (materially compromised), then the act of thinking cannot guarantee the ontological status of the thinker. The cogito assumes that thinking is self-transparent and self-validating, but this assumption collapses once we acknowledge that thinking might be, in its very structure, an error.

Imagine a malfunctioning lamp that, due to a defect in its mechanism, produces not light but a convincing simulation of light---perhaps through heat patterns or electromagnetic disturbances that create the subjective experience of illumination for an observer positioned in just the right way. The lamp ``thinks'' it is fulfilling its function, but it is fundamentally broken. Now imagine that the lamp could reflect upon itself and conclude, ``I produce light, therefore I am a lamp.'' The conclusion would be structurally invalid because the very premise (light production) is compromised.

This is the situation of the Cartesian subject once we accept material fallibility. The thinker who concludes ``I think, therefore I am'' might be like the broken lamp: the thinking itself might be the malfunction, not the guarantee of existence. The ontological claim embedded in the cogito depends upon the structural integrity of thought, but that integrity cannot be presupposed without begging the question.

The paradox is oxymoronic because it presents us with a contradiction built into the very fabric of self-conscious existence: we are beings whose primary mode of accessing Being (thought) is itself potentially an error about Being. We are malfunctions that experience themselves as functioning. This is not simply Descartes' methodological doubt externalised; it is doubt internalised into the very structure of the doubting subject.

The consequences are profound. If the cogito fails as an ontological foundation, then we need a different criterion for distinguishing what genuinely ``is'' (possesses essence) from what merely ``functions'' (appears without possessing stable structure). We need, in other words, a criterion that does not depend upon the self-testimony of potentially fallible consciousness but upon something more structurally robust.

This is the task we undertake in what follows: to articulate a criterion of essence based not on self-consciousness but on structural resistance, and to use this criterion to reclassify the ontological status of thought, institutions, concepts, and even God Himself.

\section{The Criterion of Essence: Structural Resistance}
\label{sec:criterion}

\subsection{Definition of Being (Axiom): The Structural Resistance Criterion for Essence (SRCE)}
\label{sec:srce-def}

We propose the following axiom as the foundation for a new ontological classification:

\noindent\textbf{Axiom (SRCE):} Only that can ``be'' (possess essence) which, while existing, cannot cease to be what it is without disappearing entirely.

This formulation demands careful unpacking. First, note what the criterion does not say. It does not claim that essential beings are eternal or indestructible. A particular tree can burn and cease to exist; the claim is not that the tree cannot be destroyed, but that while it exists, it cannot cease to be a tree without thereby ceasing to exist at all. The criterion concerns structural integrity, not temporal permanence.

Second, the criterion establishes a relationship between identity and existence that is stronger than mere persistence. An entity possesses essence (truly ``is'') only if its identity is so constitutive of its existence that any transformation sufficient to alter that identity would simultaneously annihilate the entity. Essence, in this view, is not an abstract universal that entities participate in; rather, essence is the structural resistance that an entity exhibits against transformations that would change what it is.

Third, and crucially, this criterion is operational. It provides a test: take any putative entity and ask whether it could undergo transformations that change its fundamental nature while continuing to exist. If so, it lacks essence in the strong sense we are articulating. It may have functions, uses, appearances---it may ``be there'' in some sense---but it does not ``be'' in the ontological sense we are demarcating.

The criterion draws inspiration from but significantly departs from classical essentialist metaphysics. Aristotle's distinction between essential and accidental properties \citep{aristotle1984} provides a historical precedent, but his criterion (what a thing cannot lose without ceasing to be that kind of thing) remains too permissive for our purposes. We are not asking about kind-membership but about structural integrity. Similarly, contemporary discussions of essence \citep{fine1994,fine2005,sider2011,tahko2017} often focus on modal properties or metaphysical grounding, but these approaches tend to remain within a conceptual framework that our criterion seeks to escape. \citet{fine1994} distinguishes essence from mere metaphysical necessity, arguing that essence concerns what a thing is, not merely what is true of it in all possible worlds. Our SRCE radicalises this insight: essence is structural resistance to identity-altering transformation, not modal profile.

Our criterion is ``negative'' in a specific sense: it determines essence not by identifying positive properties but by testing resistance to negation. An essence is revealed not by what something has but by what it cannot surrender. This negative approach has methodological advantages: rather than requiring direct access to the ``whatness'' of a thing (which might presuppose the very cognitive transparency we have questioned), we can test structural resistance empirically or conceptually.

\paragraph{Operational Test for SRCE:} To apply SRCE to any entity $E$, ask: (1) What counts as a structural transformation (one that alters $E$'s identity) versus a functional transformation (one that alters $E$'s use or role)? (2) Can $E$ undergo a structural transformation and continue to exist? If yes, $E$ merely Functions. If no---if every structural transformation annihilates $E$---then $E$ possesses Being. (3) Crucially, the relevant scale is the level at which $E$ presents itself as a unified individual (see \S\ref{sec:scope}).

\subsubsection{Scope and Unity of Individuation: Non-Triviality Constraints}
\label{sec:scope}

To prevent the SRCE from collapsing into triviality---declaring that nothing possesses essence because everything eventually decomposes---we must clarify its domain of application and the relevant scale of structural organisation.

\noindent\textbf{Definition (Scope of SRCE):} We apply the SRCE to continuants (entities that persist through time) or structural patterns that exhibit criteria of reidentification at a fixed scale of individuation. Instantaneous occurrents fall outside the scope of SRCE by triviality---they cannot undergo transformation because they do not persist.

The SRCE evaluates structure at the level where a system exhibits cohesion of parts and unity of individuation, in \citeauthor{koslicki2018}'s (\citeyear{koslicki2018}) sense of hylomorphic structure. For a tree, this is the organismic level; for a rock, the geological-material level; for a mathematical structure, its abstract organisational level. The criterion is not applied indiscriminately across all possible scales but relative to the level at which the entity presents itself as a unified, bounded individual.

\noindent\textbf{Lemma (Tolerance of Vagueness):} The SRCE accommodates moderate vagueness in boundaries without undermining its application. An entity may have fuzzy temporal or spatial boundaries while still exhibiting structural resistance at its core organisational level. The ship of Theseus poses no fundamental threat: what matters is whether gradual replacement destroys the structural unity that makes reidentification possible, not whether there is a sharp boundary between persistence and destruction.

\noindent\textbf{Lemma (Constitution versus Identity):} Following \citet{lowe2006} and \citet{koslicki2018}, we distinguish between constitution and identity. A statue may be constituted by bronze, but the statue and the bronze are not identical---they have different persistence conditions. SRCE targets identity at the relevant scale of individuation: the bronze possesses Being (it cannot cease to be bronze while remaining), but ``being-a-statue'' is a functional property of a particular configuration. This prevents trivial mereological decomposition from undermining SRCE.

This delimitation prevents absurd consequences. We are not claiming that a particular mental state (an occurrent) must resist transformation to count as Being---mental states are not the right kind of entity for SRCE evaluation. Rather, we ask whether thought-as-such (considered as a continuant process or structural kind) exhibits the requisite resistance. Similarly, we do not require that every molecule of a tree remain fixed; we require only that the organisational pattern at the relevant scale resist identity-altering transformations.

\subsection{Permitted vs. Invalidating Transformations: Function versus Structure}

The SRCE requires us to distinguish carefully between transformations that preserve essence (permitted transformations) and those that invalidate it (essence-destroying transformations). This distinction maps roughly onto the difference between changes in function and changes in structure.

A functional transformation alters how an entity is used, its role in a system, or its relationships to other entities, but leaves its internal structure intact. Consider a hammer: it can be used to drive nails, to break rocks, to wedge open a door, or simply to sit decoratively on a shelf. These are functional transformations. The hammer's use changes, but its structure (the particular configuration of wood and metal that constitutes it) remains stable.

A structural transformation, by contrast, alters the internal organisation that makes the entity what it is. If we melt the hammer's metal head and reshape it into a blade, we have performed a structural transformation. The metal persists, but the hammer does not. The transformation was essence-invalidating because the structural configuration that made the entity a hammer no longer exists.

This distinction allows us to refine the SRCE: an entity possesses essence if it can undergo functional transformations while maintaining structural integrity, but cannot undergo structural transformations without ceasing to exist. The criterion thus identifies essence with structure rather than with function, use, or relational properties.

However, we must immediately note a complication: the boundary between structure and function is not always sharp, and it may be relative to a level of description. At what level of organisation does structure reside? The hammer's structure includes the molecular bonding of its metal, but we don't typically think that rearranging individual atoms destroys the hammer. There is a question of scale and of what counts as the relevant organisational level.

We propose that the relevant level is the one at which the entity presents itself as a unified, bounded individual---what we might call the phenomenological level of individuation (following \citeauthor{koslicki2018}'s (\citeyear{koslicki2018}) work on structure and substance). A hammer is structurally unified at the scale of its visible, manipulable form. The molecular level, while causally relevant, is not the level at which hammerhood manifests. This is admittedly somewhat anthropocentric, but it reflects the fact that ontological categories are always relative to an investigative standpoint, even if what they discover at that standpoint is real.

\subsection{The Example of the Log: Being Wood versus Functioning as Furniture}

To illustrate the SRCE and its implications, consider a concrete example: a log of wood. The log can serve various functions. It can be used as a bench, as a table, as firewood, as a decorative element in garden landscaping, or as a bridge across a stream. In each case, the log is ``functioning'' in different ways---it is ``being-a-bench,'' ``being-a-table,'' etc.

But notice: in all these functional transformations, the log remains structurally a log. Its cellular structure, its fibrous organisation, its wooden materiality---these persist regardless of use. The log can stop functioning as a table (if we move it elsewhere) without ceasing to exist. It simply takes on a different function or no particular function at all.

Now consider a different transformation: suppose we burn the log. The combustion destroys its cellular structure, breaking down the complex organic molecules into simpler compounds (CO$_2$, water vapour, ash). After this transformation, the log no longer exists. The material persists in some form, but the structural organisation that made it a log has been annihilated.

According to the SRCE, we can now make a precise ontological claim: the log, as wood, possesses essence (truly ``is''), while the log-as-table merely functions (merely ``is doing''). The log can cease to be a table while continuing to exist, but it cannot cease to be wood while continuing to exist. Hence, `being-wood' qualifies as essence; `being-a-table' as function.

This example reveals the power of the criterion. It allows us to distinguish between what an entity is (its essence, its structural identity) and what it does (its function, its use, its role). Most importantly, it shows that many properties we intuitively attribute to entities---including properties that seem important or defining---are in fact merely functional, not essential.

The implications ramify. If we apply this reasoning consistently, we discover that most of what we call ``things'' in everyday discourse are actually functional designations rather than essential beings. A ``chair'' is not an essence but a function that various structures can perform. A ``vehicle'' is not an essence but a functional category. Even biological categories like ``predator'' or ``pollinator'' are functional, not essential---an organism can cease to be a predator while remaining the same organism.

\subsection{The Failure of Thought: Thought Has No Structural ``Skin''}

Now we arrive at the critical application: what about thought itself? Can thought satisfy the SRCE? Does thinking possess essence, or is it merely a function?

Consider the structure of thought. What persists when we think? Unlike the log, which has a visible, tangible structure (cellular organisation, fibrous texture, molecular composition), thought has no discernible structural ``skin.'' A thought is not bounded in space in the way material objects are. It does not have parts that maintain stable relationships to one another. Its ``structure,'' if it has one, is purely abstract---a pattern of activation in a neural substrate, a sequence of semantic relationships, a functional organisation of information.

But here is the crucial point: these structures are not resistant to transformation in the way that material structures are. A thought can be modified, revised, abandoned, or completely reversed without the thinker ceasing to exist. I can believe $X$ at time $t_1$, believe not-$X$ at time $t_2$, and believe something entirely unrelated at time $t_3$, all while remaining continuously conscious. The thought changes, but I persist.

Moreover, the character of thought---its clarity, coherence, rationality---can vary wildly without the thinking process ceasing. Confused thoughts are still thoughts. Irrational thoughts are still thoughts. Even delusional thoughts are structurally instances of thinking. There is no structural configuration that thinking must maintain to count as thinking.

This stands in stark contrast to material structures. A log must maintain its fibrous, cellular organisation to remain a log. A brain must maintain certain functional architectures to remain a brain. But thinking has no such structural requirement. It is, we might say, purely functional---it is something that happens, not something that is.

\subsubsection{Implementation versus Individuation: The Type-Token Distinction}

One might object that thinking requires minimal architectural patterns (hence structure). This objection can take several forms, and we must address each carefully to demonstrate that none provides thought with structural resistance sufficient for SRCE.

\textbf{Token Thoughts:} Consider a particular token thought---my current belief that it is raining, occurring at time $t$. This token is ephemeral. It exists for a moment and then ceases. As an instantaneous occurrent, it falls outside the scope of SRCE (see \S\ref{sec:scope}). Token thoughts cannot exhibit structural resistance because they do not persist long enough to undergo transformations. The question of whether they could be transformed while remaining identical does not arise---they simply occur and vanish.

\textbf{Type Thoughts:} Perhaps, then, thought-types exhibit the requisite structure? The type ``belief that it is raining'' can be instantiated multiple times, and the type itself seems to persist across these instantiations. But here we face a dilemma: either (a) types are abstract entities (universals, concepts, propositions), in which case they may indeed exhibit structural resistance, but they are not what the cogito refers to---Descartes is not claiming ``abstract propositions exist, therefore I am''---or (b) types are merely classificatory devices we use to group similar tokens, in which case they have no independent ontological status and certainly no structure that could resist transformation.

Moreover, even if we grant that thought-types have some form of existence, their identity conditions are entirely determined by semantic and normative considerations---by what counts as ``the same thought'' in our linguistic and cognitive practices. This is precisely the kind of functional determination that characterises Functioning rather than Being. The type ``belief that it is raining'' can be individuated only relative to our conceptual scheme, our language, our standards of sameness. It lacks the intrinsic structural unity that would allow it to resist transformation independently of these functional contexts.

\textbf{Mental Processes:} Perhaps the objection is that thinking-as-a-process has structural features---patterns of neural activation, recurrent network architectures, computational algorithms. We grant this, but it does not help. These architectural patterns are features of the implementation substrate (the brain), not of thought itself. The brain, as a material structure, may well satisfy SRCE---it has a biological organisation that cannot be arbitrarily transformed without ceasing to exist. But thinking is what the brain does, not what the brain is.

The crucial point is the dissociation between architecture and function: the same neural architecture can support radically different thoughts, and similar thoughts can be realised by different neural architectures. Thought supervenes on neural structure but is not identical to it. Therefore, necessary implementation conditions for thinking-as-such do not amount to $\Sigma$(Thought)---structural resistance of thought itself.

\noindent\textbf{Proposition:} No natural candidate for the unity of individuation of thought (token, type, or process) satisfies the SRCE without collapsing into either (i) ephemerality of occurrents, or (ii) purely functional definition relative to normative-semantic practices.

The conclusion follows directly from the SRCE: thought does not ``be''; it only ``functions.'' Thought lacks essence because it lacks structural resistance. It can be transformed indefinitely while continuing to occur. Implementation necessity $\neq$ structural resistance. Therefore, under SRCE, thought functions rather than is.

This conclusion decisively undermines the Cartesian project. If thinking merely functions rather than essentially is, then ``I think, therefore I am'' proves at most that ``I function, therefore something functions.'' But functioning is compatible with ontological emptiness. A process can occur without grounding any substantial Being.

The phenomenological force of the cogito---the apparent self-evidence of ``I think''---turns out to be a seductive illusion. What we experience as the undeniable presence of thought is actually the functional occurrence of a process in a material substrate. The process is real, but it is not a Being. It is an \textit{Estar}, not a \textit{Ser}---to invoke a distinction that the Spanish language makes available and that will structure our ontological taxonomy.

\section{The Ontological Typology: Being, Functioning, Sublimated Functioning}

\subsection{Being (Ser): Structural Resistance as Essence}

Having established the SRCE as our criterion, we can now articulate a systematic ontological typology. The first category is Being (which we shall also term \textit{Ser}, adopting the Spanish verb for ``to be'' that denotes essence):

\noindent\textbf{Being (Ser):} An entity possesses Being if and only if it exhibits structural resistance according to the SRCE. That is, it cannot cease to be what it is without ceasing to exist entirely. Entities in this category possess essence in the strongest sense.

Examples of entities that satisfy this criterion include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Material structures at the appropriate scale of individuation:} A particular rock, a specific tree (as living organism, not as ``shade-provider''), a human body (as biological structure, not as ``person'' in the social sense).
\item \textbf{Mathematical structures (arguably):} The number 3, insofar as it exists at all, cannot become something other than 3 while remaining in existence. If we accept mathematical platonism, mathematical entities would exemplify Being perfectly. We remain neutral on the ontological status of mathematical objects, noting only that \textit{if} they exist, they satisfy SRCE more robustly than material entities.
\item \textbf{Logical necessities:} The law of non-contradiction cannot be transformed while remaining in existence; any world in which it ``changed'' would simply be a world in which it didn't hold, not a world in which it persisted in altered form.
\end{itemize}

The category of Being, then, includes entities with robust structural integrity---entities whose identity is constitutive of their existence in such a way that identity-alteration entails existential annihilation.

It is important to note that Being, in this sense, is not the same as permanence or indestructibility. Beings can be destroyed; they simply cannot be transformed while remaining. A rock can be pulverised, but pulverisation destroys the rock rather than changing it into something else. The rock cannot ``become'' powder while remaining a rock; rather, the rock ceases to exist and powder comes to exist in its place.

\subsection{Functioning (Estar): Use, Function, Presence without Essence}

The second category is Functioning (or \textit{Estar}, from the Spanish verb that denotes temporary states, locations, and conditions):

\noindent\textbf{Functioning (Estar):} An entity Functions if it is present, operative, or manifest but lacks structural resistance. Such entities can undergo identity-altering transformations while continuing to exist (at some level of description). They are characterised by use, role, or temporary configuration rather than by essential structure.

Examples include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Thought and mental states:} As we have argued, thoughts lack structural resistance. A belief can be revised, an emotion can shift, a desire can be extinguished, all without the thinker ceasing to exist.
\item \textbf{Functional artefacts:} A ``chair'' as such Functions rather than Is. The material substrate may Be (the wood or metal), but chairhood is purely functional. The same physical structure can function as a chair, a stepladder, or kindling.
\item \textbf{Social roles:} A ``teacher,'' ``citizen,'' or ``criminal'' is a functional designation. The person may Be (biologically), but teacherhood is a social function that can be acquired and lost.
\item \textbf{Institutional entities:} A corporation, a nation-state, a university---these are functional organisations that can undergo radical transformations (of membership, purpose, structure) while maintaining nominal identity.
\item \textbf{Artificial intelligences:} An AI system Functions. It processes information and produces outputs, but it has no structural resistance. Its code can be rewritten, its weights adjusted, its architecture modified, all while the ``same'' AI (in some functional sense) persists.
\end{itemize}

The category of Functioning captures most of what we encounter in everyday life. The world is populated far more by Functionings than by Beings. This is not to say that Functionings are unreal or unimportant---indeed, much of what matters to us falls into this category. But they lack the ontological robustness of Beings.

A crucial implication: the self, as experienced, is Functioning rather than Being. The phenomenological ``I'' that seems so immediate in the cogito is actually a functional unity---a dynamic process that maintains a degree of continuity through memory and narrative but that lacks structural essence. The ``I'' can change beliefs, values, personality traits, even memories (through forgetting or confabulation), while remaining in some sense ``the same person.'' This continuity is functional and narrative, not structural.

\subsection{Sublimated Functioning (Estar Sublimat): Deified Functions}

The third and most subtle category is Sublimated Functioning (\textit{Estar Sublimat}):

\noindent\textbf{Sublimated Functioning (Estar Sublimat):} An entity Sublimately Functions if it is actually Functioning (lacks essence) but is treated, experienced, or conceptualised as if it possessed Being. Sublimated Functionings are ``deified functions''---they are elevated to the status of essences despite their lack of structural resistance.

This category is crucial because it captures a widespread phenomenon in human culture and cognition: the tendency to essentialise what is actually functional. We take patterns, relationships, social constructs, and abstract ideas and grant them the ontological status of Beings. We treat them as if they possessed essence, as if they could not be other than they are, when in fact they are contingent, mutable, and structurally empty.

Examples include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The Nation or Patria:} National identity is treated as essential---``I am French'' or ``I am American''---when it is actually a functional identification with a political-cultural system. Nationhood is Functioning, but it is experienced and defended as Being.
\item \textbf{Justice:} We speak of Justice as if it were an eternal, unchanging essence---``Justice demands...'' or ``True Justice requires...''---when in fact concepts of justice vary radically across cultures and historical periods. Justice Functions powerfully in human affairs, but it does not Be.
\item \textbf{God (in certain theological conceptions):} When God is conceived as the ``Ground of Being,'' the ``Necessary Existent,'' or ``Being Itself,'' there is an attempt to place God in the category of Being. But as we shall argue in detail below, God as typically conceived is better understood as Sublimated Functioning---a concept that Functions with immense cultural and psychological power but that lacks the structural resistance required for Being.
\end{itemize}

Sublimated Functioning is not mere error or illusion. The fact that something is Functioning rather than Being does not make it unimportant or ineffective. Indeed, Sublimated Functionings often exercise more power over human affairs than mere Beings do. A rock (Being) may be ontologically robust, but it rarely inspires devotion or motivates action. Justice (Sublimated Functioning) may lack essence, but it structures legal systems and motivates revolutions.

The danger of Sublimation lies not in its functional power but in the conceptual confusion it creates. When we mistake Functioning for Being, we immunise our concepts against revision. We treat as necessary what is actually contingent, as eternal what is actually historical, as natural what is actually constructed. This category, then, has critical as well as descriptive force: identifying something as Sublimated Functioning is to denaturalise it, to reveal its contingency, to open it to transformation.

\subsection{Application of Sublimated Functioning: Patria and Justice}

Let us examine key instances of Sublimated Functioning in detail, to clarify the category and its implications.

\textbf{The Nation (Patria):} National identity provides perhaps the clearest example of Sublimated Functioning. People routinely say ``I am American'' or ``I am Japanese'' with the verb of Being, as if nationality were an essential property akin to biological species membership. National anthems, patriotic rhetoric, and citizenship laws all reinforce this essentialisation.

Yet national boundaries are historical contingencies. The concept of the nation-state is a relatively recent invention (emerging primarily in the 18th and 19th centuries). The criteria for national membership vary widely and arbitrarily. An individual's nationality can change through immigration and naturalisation---a transformation that would be impossible if nationality were truly essential. Most tellingly, nations themselves undergo radical transformations: borders shift, political systems change, cultures evolve. The ``France'' of 1025 and the ``France'' of 2025 share little beyond a name and a geographical approximation.

The nation, then, clearly Functions rather than Is. But it Functions in a Sublimated mode: it is experienced as essential, defended as sacred, and treated as a ground of identity that cannot be surrendered without loss of self. People will die for their nation---the ultimate existential commitment---despite its ontological emptiness.

\textbf{Justice:} The concept of justice plays a foundational role in ethical and political philosophy. From Plato's \textit{Republic} \citep{plato1997a} to contemporary discussions \citep{rawls1971}, philosophers have sought to articulate what Justice essentially is. But the history of these articulations reveals radical variance. Athenian justice included slavery. Mediaeval Christian justice included religious persecution. Contemporary liberal justice includes protections that would have been unintelligible to earlier periods.

This variability demonstrates that Justice is not a Being with fixed structure but a Functioning that takes different forms in different contexts. Yet it is persistently Sublimated: we speak of ``Justice itself,'' of ``true Justice,'' of Justice as a standard that transcends human convention. This Sublimation is functionally necessary for justice to operate normatively---if it were understood as merely conventional, its force would be diminished. But the Sublimation obscures the historical contingency and cultural specificity of justice-concepts.

These examples reveal a pattern: Sublimated Functionings tend to be concepts that (1) serve important functional roles (identity, social organisation, motivation), (2) are historically and culturally variable in their specifics, (3) are nevertheless treated as eternal and essential, (4) command powerful emotional and existential investment, and (5) are resistant to rational critique precisely because of their Sublimated status.

Identifying these as Sublimated Functionings does not require abandoning them---we may well continue to participate in nations and pursue justice. But it does require recognising their contingency and remaining open to their transformation.

\section{The Limit of the System: Essential Truth}

\subsection{The Only Candidate for Pure Being: Applying the Criterion to ``Truth''}

Having established our ontological typology and populated its categories with various entities, we now confront a question: is there anything that satisfies the SRCE so completely, so unconditionally, that it represents Being in its purest form? Is there an entity whose structural resistance is absolute?

We propose that there is, and that it is: Truth.

Not truth-claims, not propositions, not our beliefs or theories---these are all Functionings, subject to revision and error. Rather, we mean Truth as such: the property or state of affairs in which reality is accurately represented or disclosed. Truth in this sense is not a human construction but a fundamental feature of reality---the correspondence or isomorphism between representation and represented, between thought and thing, between claim and fact.

\textbf{Truth: Minimal Commitments}

Our claim that Truth is does not presuppose robust Platonism or any particular substantive theory of truth. It requires only two minimal theses:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] \textbf{Idempotence:} If a proposition is true, it is true---truth does not gradually morph into non-truth. There is no process by which something true becomes partially true, quasi-true, or proto-false while remaining in existence as truth. Truth is, in this sense, discrete rather than continuous.
\item[(ii)] \textbf{Invariance:} Where truth fails to hold, it simply fails; there is no intermediate ``structural change'' of Truth as such. When we discover that a proposition we thought true is actually false, we do not observe Truth transforming; rather, we recognise that Truth was never instantiated in that case. Truth does not undergo metamorphosis; it is either present or absent.
\end{enumerate}

These minimal theses suffice for SRCE: Truth cannot cease to be what it is without ceasing altogether, hence qualifies as Being. The argument does not depend on choosing between correspondence, coherence, pragmatist, or deflationary theories of truth \citep{horwich1998,field2001}. Regardless of how we analyse the truth-predicate, the structural invariance we have identified holds.

To test whether Truth satisfies the SRCE, we ask: can Truth undergo identity-altering transformations while continuing to exist? Can Truth become something other than Truth while remaining?

The answer appears to be no. Truth cannot ``become'' falsehood while remaining Truth. It cannot be ``partially transformed'' into something else. There is no process by which Truth could gradually shade into non-Truth while persisting as an entity. Any scenario in which Truth ceased to be what it is would simultaneously be a scenario in which Truth ceased to exist entirely.

This is not merely a conceptual or definitional point, as if we were simply stipulating that ``Truth'' must mean something invariant. Rather, it reflects something about the structure of reality itself. The relation of correspondence (or however we wish to characterise Truth) is such that it cannot be other than it is. It is, in the language of classical metaphysics, necessarily what it is.

Consider the alternatives. Could Truth ``change''? Not in any meaningful sense. We might discover new truths or correct our understanding of old truths, but these are changes in our epistemic relationship to Truth, not changes in Truth itself. The truth that $2+2=4$ does not change when we learn it; our knowledge changes, but the truth is invariant.

Could Truth be ``transformed'' into something else while remaining? Again, no. If what we thought was true turned out to be false, we were simply wrong---Truth itself did not transform. Truth does not admit of degrees or gradations that would allow for partial transformation. Either the correspondence relation holds or it doesn't; there is no intermediate state.

Could Truth cease to be Truth without ceasing to exist? This question verges on incoherence. What would it mean for Truth to exist but not be Truth? The very identity of Truth is exhausted by its being the relation of accurate representation. To imagine Truth existing as non-Truth is to imagine a logical impossibility.

\subsubsection{Logical Objections: Non-Classical Logics and Pluralism}

Several objections from contemporary logic and philosophy of language might seem to threaten our claim that Truth Is. We address the three most significant:

\textbf{Dialetheism \citep{priest2006}:} Dialetheism holds that some propositions are both true and false---that contradictions can be true. Does this undermine our claim that Truth exhibits structural resistance? No. Even if there are true contradictions, what the SRCE affirms is that the condition of truth (the property of being true) does not admit transformation into non-truth while maintaining identity. A paraconsistent framework that tolerates true contradictions does not convert Truth-as-a-condition into a mutable entity; it simply relaxes the classical consequence relation. The idempotence and invariance of truth-as-property remain intact: when a proposition is true (even if also false, in dialethic systems), its being-true does not gradually morph into being-non-true.

\textbf{Truth-Value Gaps and Gluts:} Some semantic theories posit propositions that are neither true nor false (gaps) or both true and false (gluts). Do these intermediate states represent ``partial transformations'' of Truth? Again, no. The SRCE's claim operates at a meta-theoretical level: the predicate ``true'' maintains its normative role across these systems. When truth fails to apply (in gaps), it doesn't undergo structural change---it simply fails to apply. When both truth and falsity apply (in gluts), we have not transformed Truth into something else but rather applied both predicates simultaneously. The structural invariance of Truth-as-normative-status is preserved.

\textbf{Alethic Pluralism \citep{wright1992,lynch2009}:} Pluralists argue that truth means different things in different domains---correspondence in empirical domains, coherence in mathematical domains, warranted assertibility in moral domains, etc. Does this domain-relativity undermine Truth's claim to Being? Not if we distinguish between thick and thin conceptions. The SRCE affirms the invariance of the truth-role (what \citeauthor{kripke1975} (\citeyear{kripke1975}) calls the ``disquotational'' or ``transparent'' function) across domains. Even if truth's nature varies by domain (the pluralist thesis), the structural function that truth performs---making propositions answerable to something beyond mere assertion---remains constant. Moreover, most pluralists acknowledge a minimal ``thin'' truth-property that all domains share. It is this thin truth-role that satisfies SRCE, regardless of how we flesh out domain-specific truth-conditions.

These responses demonstrate that our claim about Truth is compatible with significant diversity in logical and semantic theorising. What remains invariant across these frameworks is precisely what SRCE requires: Truth-as-normative-status cannot be transformed while maintaining identity.

\subsection{Why Truth ``Is'': Truth Cannot Cease to Be What It Is Without Disappearing}

The conclusion follows: Truth possesses Being in the strictest sense. Truth Is.

This claim requires careful qualification. We are not claiming that Truth is a substance or entity in the traditional metaphysical sense---a ``thing'' that exists independently in some Platonic realm. Rather, Truth is a structural feature of reality, a relation or property that cannot be otherwise. Whether we conceive Truth as a correspondence relation, a coherence property, or in some other way, the point remains: Truth exhibits absolute structural resistance.

This has profound implications. If Truth is the only entity that fully and unconditionally satisfies the SRCE, then Truth occupies a unique ontological position. Everything else---all material structures, all Functionings, all Sublimated Functionings---exists at a lower grade of Being. They possess ontological status only insofar as they stand in some relation to Truth: they are truly material structures, they truly function, they are truly Sublimated.

In other words, Truth is not merely an entity with essence; it is the condition for any entity to have determinate status at all. The Being of beings depends on their relation to Truth. A rock ``is'' a rock truly; thought ``functions'' truly; justice ``is Sublimated'' truly. Without Truth, there would be no determinate facts of the matter about what anything is or does.

This moves us towards what we might call a Truth-centric ontology: an ontological framework in which Truth is the fundamental category and all other categories are derivative. Being, Functioning, and Sublimated Functioning are all modes of existence that presuppose Truth. Nothing can be, function, or be Sublimated except insofar as it is true that it does so.

\subsection{The Double Status: ``Truth That Is'' versus ``Truth That Functions''}
\label{sec:double-truth}

To avoid category mistakes, we distinguish Truth-that-Is (the ontological invariant) from truths-that-function (our representational acts). However, we must introduce an important distinction to avoid confusion: the distinction between Truth-that-Is (essential Truth, Truth as ontological foundation) and Truth-that-Functions (particular truths, truth-claims, our epistemic access to Truth).

\begin{table}[h]

\end{tabular}
\caption{The Double Status of Truth}
\label{tab:double-truth}
\end{table}

Truth-that-Is refers to Truth in the ontological sense we have been discussing---the fundamental correspondence relation, the structure of reality that makes determinate facts possible. This Truth Is; it possesses Being; it cannot be otherwise. It is not something we create or construct; it is something we discover or fail to discover. It is prior to and independent of all human cognition.

Truth-that-Functions refers to our formulations of truth, our particular truth-claims, the propositions we assert or the beliefs we hold. These are Functionings, not Beings. A particular truth-claim---say, ``the Earth orbits the Sun''---can be affirmed, denied, revised, or replaced. It can be expressed in different languages, symbolised in different notations, embedded in different theories. It has all the characteristics of Functioning: malleability, contextuality, dependence on human practice.

Moreover, truth-claims can be false. We can assert as true what is actually false, and this assertion Functions in our cognitive economy even though it fails to correspond to Truth-that-Is. A false belief is still a belief; it still guides action, still coheres (or fails to cohere) with other beliefs, still operates in our mental life. It Functions, even though it fails to track Truth.

This distinction is crucial for avoiding a potential objection: if Truth Is, then aren't particular truths also Beings? The answer is no, because particular truths are always truth-claims or truth-formulations---they are human representations of Truth-that-Is, and representations are Functionings. What Is is not the claim ``$2+2=4$'' but the fact that $2+2=4$; our claim points towards this fact but does not constitute it.

We can thus affirm both that Truth Is (in its ontological essence) and that truths Function (in their epistemic manifestation). There is no contradiction here, only a distinction between levels of ontological analysis.

This double status has important epistemological consequences. If Truth Is but truth-claims Function, then we can never be absolutely certain that our particular truth-claims correspond to Truth-that-Is. We might be wrong about any particular matter. But this fallibilism about particular truths does not undermine the claim that Truth Is; rather, it presupposes it. We can be wrong only if there is a fact of the matter---a Truth---that our beliefs fail to track.

The Cartesian dream of absolute certainty through the cogito collapses, but not into relativism or scepticism. Rather, it collapses into a humbler epistemic position: we can have confidence without certainty, we can pursue Truth without claiming to possess it completely, we can revise our beliefs while affirming that Truth remains constant.

\section{Conclusion: The Ontological Subordination of God}

\subsection{God Under the Criterion: The Supreme Instance of Sublimated Functioning}
\label{sec:god-srce}

We arrive now at the most provocative application of our framework: the ontological status of God. In Western philosophical theology, God has traditionally been conceived as the supreme Being, the \textit{ens realissimum}, Being Itself, or the Ground of all being. From Anselm's ``that than which nothing greater can be conceived'' to Aquinas's \textit{ipsum esse subsistens} (subsistent being itself) \citep{aquinas1920} to contemporary perfect being theology \citep{plantinga1974}, the theological tradition has insisted that God Is in the most absolute and perfect sense.

But does God satisfy the SRCE? Can we legitimately place God in the category of Being, or must God be reclassified?

Consider the question: can God cease to be what God is without ceasing to exist? The answer depends on how we conceive God, but for most traditional conceptions, the answer is yes---or at least, the question is far from straightforward.

First, different religious traditions and theological systems have radically different conceptions of God. The God of classical theism (omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good, immaterial, eternal) differs markedly from the God of process theology (dipolar, temporal, growing in knowledge), which differs from pantheistic conceptions (God as identical to Nature/Universe), which differs from panentheistic conceptions (God as including but exceeding Nature), which differs from various polytheistic systems.

If ``God'' were truly a Being---if God possessed essence in the strong sense---these radical conceptual variations would be impossible. We could not coherently describe such different entities with the same term unless ``God'' were a functional designation rather than an essential one. The diversity of God-concepts suggests that ``God'' names a role, a function, or a position in a conceptual system rather than a determinate structure.

Second, even within a single tradition, the concept of God evolves. The God of early biblical texts is anthropomorphic, localised, emotional, and even morally ambiguous. The God of later theological development becomes abstract, immaterial, impassible, and perfectly good. These cannot be straightforward discoveries about a fixed entity; they must be conceptual transformations. But if the concept of God can undergo such radical transformation, then God lacks the structural resistance required for Being.

Third, and most fundamentally, God-as-conceived is always God-as-interpreted-by-human-cognition. We have no access to ``God Himself'' apart from concepts, symbols, experiences, and traditions---all of which are Functionings. Even if there were some divine reality corresponding to our God-concepts, what we engage with is always the concept, not the reality directly. And concepts are paradigmatic instances of Functioning.

\textbf{Scope Clarification:} Our analysis operates at the level of onto-semantics---we are examining how ``God'' functions in religious and philosophical discourse, and what ontological status the God-concept possesses. We are not making a direct metaphysical claim about whether some transcendent divine reality exists independently of human concepts. Rather, we are analysing the conceptual entity ``God'' that appears in theological systems and asking whether it exhibits structural resistance. The answer is that it does not: God-as-concept is Sublimated Functioning.

\paragraph{Reply to Classical Theism:} Classical theism, particularly in the Thomistic tradition \citep{aquinas1920}, conceives God as perfectly simple (\textit{simplicitas}), immutable, impassible, and necessary. Does divine simplicity provide the structural resistance required for SRCE? We argue it does not, for two reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] \textbf{Simplicity as modal profile, not structural resistance:} Divine simplicity is typically formulated as a modal claim (God has no parts, no accidents, no composition of essence and existence). But SRCE does not concern \textit{what} an entity has; it concerns \textit{whether} the entity can undergo identity-altering transformation while remaining. Even if God is simple and immutable, the question remains: is ``God'' a structurally unified individual at a determinate scale of individuation, or is it a functional role that various theological conceptions fill differently? The radical diversity of God-concepts across traditions suggests the latter.

\item[(ii)] \textbf{Immutability as stipulation, not demonstration:} The claim that God cannot change is a theological postulate, not an SRCE-derived conclusion. To satisfy SRCE, we would need to show that God \textit{structurally cannot} be other than what God is---that any transformation would annihilate God. But theological immutability is typically defended on perfection-theoretic grounds (a perfect being cannot change, because change implies either gaining or losing perfection), not on structural grounds. Moreover, the very intelligibility of divine freedom (God's choice to create or not create) suggests that God's relational properties can vary, which threatens immutability.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Reply to Perfect Being Theology:} Perfect being theology \citep{plantinga1974} attempts to derive God's attributes from the concept of maximal greatness. Does maximal greatness entail structural resistance? Again, we argue it does not. Maximal greatness is an evaluative, not a structural, property. An entity can be maximally great (possess all great-making properties to the maximum degree) without thereby satisfying SRCE. The question is not whether God is perfect but whether the God-concept exhibits structural unity that resists identity-altering transformation. The persistence of theological disputes about divine attributes (Does God have libertarian freedom? Is God temporal? Does God know counterfactuals of creaturely freedom?) demonstrates that ``God'' functions as a contested conceptual role, not as a structurally determinate Being.

The conclusion seems inescapable: God, as the term functions in human religious and philosophical discourse, is Sublimated Functioning, not Being. God is the supreme instance of deified function---a concept that is treated as essential, worshipped as absolute, defended as necessary, but that lacks structural resistance and therefore lacks essence.

This is not atheism. We are not claiming that God does not exist, if by ``exist'' we mean ``Functions.'' God clearly Functions---and does so with enormous power and consequence. Billions of people organise their lives around God-concepts; civilisations rise and fall in God's name; moral systems are grounded in divine commands; existential meaning is derived from relationship with God. As a Functioning, God is extraordinarily robust.

But Functioning, even Sublimated Functioning, is not Being. And if God is not Being, then God cannot serve as the ontological foundation that theology has traditionally claimed. God cannot be the ``Ground of Being'' if God does not, strictly speaking, Be.

\subsection{Ontological Dependence: God Functions; Truth Is}

The ontological structure we have articulated establishes a hierarchy: Truth Is, while everything else (including God) either Functions or Sublimately Functions. This means that God's existence (in whatever sense God exists) is dependent on Truth, but Truth's existence is not dependent on God.

Consider: even if God exists, the statement ``God exists'' is either true or false. Its truth or falsity does not depend on God's will or decree but on the correspondence between the statement and reality. God cannot make ``God exists'' false if God does exist, nor make it true if God does not exist. The Truth of God's existence (or non-existence) is logically and ontologically prior to God Himself.

Similarly, if God issues commands, those commands are either truly issued or not truly issued---and this truth is independent of God's authority. If God creates the world, then it is true that God created the world, and this truth is not itself created by God. Truth conditions even God's creative activity.

This inverts the traditional theological hierarchy. In classical theology, God is the foundation: Truth is true because God knows it or wills it; Being exists because God creates or sustains it; goodness is good because God commands or exemplifies it. But in our framework, Truth is the foundation: God exists (if at all) truly; God's commands are commands truly; God's knowledge is knowledge truly. Truth is the condition for God's existence, not vice versa.

This subordination of God to Truth resolves several classical theological puzzles. Can God create a stone so heavy He cannot lift it? Can God make $2+2=5$? Can God deceive? These questions generate paradoxes if we assume God is absolutely omnipotent. But if God is subordinate to Truth, the paradoxes dissolve: God cannot do what is logically impossible or make true what is necessarily false, not because of a limitation in God's power but because logical necessity and Truth are ontologically prior to divine action.

\paragraph{Reply to Modal Arguments \citep{plantinga1974}}

One might object using modal arguments from perfect being theology, particularly Plantinga's modal ontological argument: if it is possible that a necessarily existing being exists, then that being exists in all possible worlds, including the actual world. Therefore, God (conceived as a necessarily existing being) exists.

We have two responses:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] \textbf{Modal necessity does not entail structural resistance:} Even if we grant that God exists in all possible worlds (metaphysical necessity), this does not demonstrate that God satisfies SRCE. Necessary existence is a modal profile---it concerns \textit{that} God exists across worlds. SRCE concerns structural integrity---whether God's identity (what God is) can be transformed while God continues to exist. The two questions are distinct. An entity could exist necessarily while lacking determinate structural unity---indeed, this might describe precisely the God-concept's situation. The number 3 (if it exists) exists necessarily, and it also satisfies SRCE. But God-concepts exhibit radical variability (omnitemporality vs. atemporality, simple vs. complex, impassible vs. passible), suggesting that ``God'' designates a functional role rather than a structural unity.

\item[(ii)] \textbf{The Euthyphro of Truth:} Even if God exists necessarily, the truth that God exists necessarily is not grounded in God's will or nature but in Truth itself. God cannot make it false that necessarily existing beings exist; the modal structure of reality (including facts about what is necessary) is prior to God. Thus, even modal arguments presuppose Truth's ontological priority, which is precisely our thesis.
\end{enumerate}

This Euthyphro structure (either God is subordinate to Truth, or Truth is arbitrary) forces a choice: either we accept that divine commands, divine existence, and divine necessity are all conditioned by Truth (our position), or we accept that Truth itself is arbitrary and subject to divine will (which collapses into a form of voluntarism that few theologians accept). The first horn preserves Truth as Being; the second undermines it, but at the cost of making all knowledge (including theological knowledge) radically contingent.

\subsection{Final Aphorism: ``God May Not Be; Truth Cannot Not Be''}

We conclude with an aphorism that encapsulates our ontological framework:

\begin{center}
\textit{``God may fail to be; Truth cannot fail to be.''}
\end{center}

This statement crystallises the ontological asymmetry we have articulated. God's existence is contingent---at least, it is an open question whether God exists, and it is coherent to affirm or deny God's existence. Theism and atheism are both internally consistent positions. God ``may not be'' in the sense that God's existence is not necessary (even if some theological traditions claim it is); it is something that could be otherwise.

But Truth's existence---or rather, Truth's Being---is not contingent. Truth cannot not be. The denial of Truth is self-refuting: if it is true that Truth does not exist, then Truth exists (at least as the truth of that very claim). If it is false that Truth does not exist, then Truth exists. The claim ``Truth does not exist'' cannot be coherently asserted or thought, because any assertion or thought presupposes the framework of Truth within which the assertion can be true or false.

This is not a proof of God's non-existence. It is a demonstration of an ontological ordering: whatever exists does so truly, and Truth is therefore the foundation of all existence. God, if He exists, exists truly---but Truth does not exist divinely. Truth Is; God Functions (albeit in a supremely Sublimated mode).

The implications for theology and philosophy of religion are profound. If God cannot be the ontological foundation, then theological projects that ground morality, meaning, or Being itself in God must be reconsidered. Ethics cannot be ultimately grounded in divine command (for the truth of divine commands presupposes Truth). Meaning cannot be ultimately grounded in God's purposes (for the truth of those purposes presupposes Truth). Being cannot be ultimately grounded in God's creative activity (for the truth that God creates presupposes Truth).

This does not render God irrelevant. God may still Function centrally in human life as a source of moral guidance, existential meaning, and communal identity. But God's functional importance does not translate into ontological priority. The Sublimated Functioning of God is powerful and consequential, but it is not foundational.

This is an ontological re-ordering, not a refutation of theism: within SRCE, divine discourse operates as Sublimated Functioning whose standing is conditioned by Truth's necessity. Religious practice, theological reflection, and spiritual experience can continue to play vital roles in human flourishing while acknowledging the conceptual structure we have identified. What changes is not the legitimacy of religious life but the philosophical understanding of its ontological foundations.

We are left, then, with an ontology that is both austere and unsettling: at the foundation of reality stands not a personal God, not a cosmic mind, not even Being in the traditional sense, but Truth---impersonal, necessary, resistant to all transformation. It is an ontology that offers no comfort, no narrative, no telos. But it is, we contend, an ontology that cannot coherently be denied, for any denial would presuppose the very Truth it seeks to reject.
